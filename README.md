# Grover’s Algorithm — Classical (Monte Carlo Simulaton) vs Quantum Search

This repository contains a Python implementation of Grover’s algorithm,
alongside a classical brute-force search using a Monte Carlo simulation, developed as part of an MSci Physics programme.

The project focuses on algorithmic structure, computational complexity,
and performance scaling, demonstrating how quantum amplitude amplification
leads to a quadratic speedup in unstructured search problems.

## Contents

## Relevance to Quantitative Roles
Search and optimisation problems arise frequently in quantitative finance,
from parameter calibration to strategy optimisation. This project demonstrates
the ability to translate theoretical algorithms into working, analyzable code.
